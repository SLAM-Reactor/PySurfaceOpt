# PySurfaceOpt

The goal is to take a set of coils and optimize them for quasiaxisymmetry on a number of surfaces.

## Installation

To use this code, first clone the repository including all its submodules, via

    git clone --recursive 

and then install [SIMSOPT](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt) via

    pip install -e simsopt/

Refer to the SIMSOPT installation instructions [here](https://simsopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#virtual-environments) if you have any trouble installing it.

Finally, install PySurfaceOpt using

    pip install -e .

## Examples

## How are things structured?

The different penalty terms of the optimization problem are implemented using the optimizable framework in SIMSOPT for efficient caching.
The dependencies between the various quantities result in a graph that can be used for caching, i.e., penalty terms are only recomputed when quantities that they depend on are changed.
For example, the toroidal flux penalty term depends both on the geometry of the computed Boozer surface and the magnetic field computed via the Biot Savart law.
We show a simplified dependency graph of the quantities used to optimize for quasiaxisymmetry in Figure \ref{fig:opt_graph} to illustrate how this works for a single Boozer surface computed from the magnetic field generated by four coils and four currents.
The full optimization problem solved in section \ref{sec:opt} results in a much more complex dependency graph..
